# The tile class contains specific behavior for each tile along with the values that each tile contains (mine, flag or empty).
# Additionally, the state of each tile determines the image used to cover it. There are images for selected squares, unselected squares,
# tiles with mines, tiles with flags and tiles with numbers.
